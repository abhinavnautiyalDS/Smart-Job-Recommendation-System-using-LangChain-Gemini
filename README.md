# Smart Job Recommender - Gemini RAG System


## Project Overview
Finding a job or internship is time-consuming and frustrating for many students:You have to search on multiple websites (Google Jobs, LinkedIn, etc.).You see lots of irrelevant job posts that donâ€™t match your skills.You waste time reading through dozens of descriptions.
What if you could have an AI assistant that:
- Reads your resume or skills.
- Searches for jobs online.
- Picks the ones that match you best.
- Explains why theyâ€™re a good fit.


## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

This project aims to build an AI-powered job recommendation web application that helps students and fresh graduates quickly find the most relevant job or internship opportunities.
The app will use LangChain, Googleâ€™s Gemini LLM, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to:

- Understand the userâ€™s skills, experience, and preferences from either a PDF resume or manual input.
- Retrieve relevant job postings from Google Jobs or LinkedIn Jobs using SerpAPI.
- Match and rank jobs based on skill relevance.
- Provide short, personalized explanations for each recommendation.

The application will be developed with Streamlit to deliver an interactive and user-friendly experience, making job searching smarter, faster, and more personalized.
